# CISCO-Intrusion-detection-Motion-detector-Siren-and-CCTV-IOT-system
"Excited to share my latest project from the lab! ðŸš¨ 

Iâ€™ve developed a simple yet powerful intrusion detection system that can be fully controlled remotely using a wireless tablet. Hereâ€™s how it works:

When motion is detected, the system instantly activates a siren, sending an audible alert. At the same time, a connected CCTV camera starts recording the area.
The best part? I can manage the entire system from anywhere using my tablet! ðŸ“± Whether itâ€™s checking the live feed or adjusting settings, itâ€™s all done wirelessly through my home network.
All devices, including the motion detector, siren, and CCTV, are seamlessly connected through my home router, making this a fully integrated and efficient security solution.
