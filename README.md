# CISCO-Intrusion-detection-Motion-detector-Siren-and-CCTV-IOT-system
Hello!!!
in the lab I created a simple intrusion detection system which is connected and controlled using a remote tablet,
once motion is detected with my motion detector, a siren comes on coupled with a connected CCTV, i am able to remotely operate the system using a configured wireless tablet. all devices are connected to my home router.
